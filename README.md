A dash app to visualize stock exchange data from 1965 to the present. 
It plots the stock data from stock exchanges - NYA, IXIC etc. It displays info like opening price, volume which is the number of shares traded during trading day etc. A range slider is provided which can be used to view the data between a given time interval.
