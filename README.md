# StockViz
![Image](Isolated.png "Demo")
A dash app to visualize stock exchange data from 1965 to the present. 
It plots the stock data from stock exchanges - NYA, IXIC etc. It displays info like opening price, volume which is the number of shares traded during trading day etc. A range slider is provided which can be used to view the data between a given time interval.

## Inspiration
 [forex](https://dash.gallery/dash-web-trader/). I decided to use dash to build myy app. I used a [kaggle 


Here is the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mattiuzc/stock-exchange-data/code?datasetId=1387282&sortBy=voteCount).
